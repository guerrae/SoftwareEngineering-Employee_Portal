# Employee Portal

This project is intended to facilitate employee access to a web portal and allow them to complete 
administrative functions. This web portal is also designed to provide login authentication for all users. 
Every user will be verified and will be granted access to only their appropriate department links. 
The app is efficient and easy to use with all functionality readily available. The app is currently
being hosted by github pages so a database is unavailable. The web app can be accesed [here](https://guerrae.github.io/SoftwareEngineering-Employee_Portal/#/).
